# Gift card 🎁

## Firstly thanks for thinking about supporting me 😇
<br />

### You can send me giftcards to show support to my page.  Usually everyone in github uses github sponsers, buy me a coffee, opencollective, patreon, etc for collecting donations. Thats the real method but I can't use them because there aren't many people to sponser me.  So I find its easier when it comes to giftcards.
